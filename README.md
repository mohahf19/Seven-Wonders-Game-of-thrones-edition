# Seven Houses: CS319 Project by Group 3H (CS319-3H-SW)




Description
-
7 Wonders is a card drafting game that is played using three decks of cards featuring depictions of ancient civilizations, military conflicts and commercial activity.

Our rendition of the 7 Wonders game is a deck card game called the “Seven Houses” that features the seven houses of the TV series titled “Game of Thrones”. When the game starts, each player randomly receives a banner which depicts their respective house out of the 7 houses. Players should then place cards representing various materials/ structures/ strengths around their banners in order to fulfill the objective of constructing their fortress.

The game is played over three ages, known in the game as Ages I, II and III, each using its own decks of cards. In each age, seven cards are randomly dealt to each player. Each player selects a card to play from his or her hand, then passes the remaining cards (face-down) to the next player. This process is repeated until five out of the seven cards have been played. At this point, each player must choose to play one of his remaining two cards and discard the other.

Each age card represents a structure, and playing a card is referred to as building a structure for the house. In order to build a structure the player must pay the construction cost, in terms of coins or the resource types, then lay it down by his or her House banner. A player lacking the resources may pay his direct neighbors to use their resources (if available).

Instead of building a structure, a player may choose either to discard an Age card to earn three coins from the bank or to use the card to build a stage of his or her wonder. The Wonder boards have from two to four stages, shown at the bottom of the board. To build a wonder stage, a player must pay the resource cost listed on the stage, then put an age card underneath the wonder board in the appropriate place.

At the end of each age, military conflicts between neighbors are resolved by comparing the number of shield symbols they have and victory points are awarded accordingly. Once all three decks have been played, players tally their scores in all the different developed areas (civil, scientific, commercial, etc.) The player with the most victory points wins.
